# Resources
1. Some problems taken from [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) by Allen Downey.  This is a good introductory resource, especially if you want to focus on analysis.
2. David Beazly gave a talk called [Builtin Superheroes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6VSAsKAj98) on using the builtin collections for data analysis.
